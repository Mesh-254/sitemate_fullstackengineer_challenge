# Issue Tracker (React + Flask)

This project is a simple **Issue Tracker** web application using a **React** frontend and **Python Flask** backend. It demonstrates basic **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through a REST API. The client sends requests to the Flask server, which performs the operations and returns static or logged data.

## Features
- **Create**: Submit a new issue to the server.
- **Read**: Fetch a list of issues or a single issue from the server.
- **Update**: Modify an existing issue.
- **Delete**: Remove an issue from the list.

## Prerequisites

### Backend (Flask)
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- flask-cors (to enable communication between the frontend and backend)

### Frontend (React)
- Node.js
- npm or yarn (for managing React dependencies)
